1. DS_ALGO - Data Structure and Algorithm
	a. I am implementing the concepts that I am learning from Data Structure and Algorithm course found freely (will put links in comments of the code)
2. Biological_Systems - This is Phd work and future career related
	a. Tools - I am putting tools that I find useful
	b. Tutorials - I am writing out tutorials as I do them.
	c. Data - Here I will put all data related to paper published for phd and onwards.
3. ML - Machine Learning, I will be working on a lot of different fields here, I wil update this as I progress
